Conversation Summary – INA219 Calibration and CO_Skeleton Updates
Date: March 27, 2025

1. User asked how to calibrate the INA219 current sensor.
2. Explained calibration using a 50A / 75mV shunt (0.0015 ohms), choosing a Current_LSB of 1.5mA.
3. Calculated the calibration register value as 18204 for full-scale range up to 50A.
4. User requested help updating their Arduino code (CO_Skeleton_02.cpp) to use the calibration value.
5. Implemented the following updates in CO_Skeleton_03.cpp:
   - Defined REG_CALIBRATION and REG_CURRENT.
   - Added writeCalibration() function and called it in setup().
   - Rewrote readCurrent() to use the INA219’s current register with scaling.
6. User requested to add power measurement functionality.
7. Implemented the following in CO_Skeleton_03_Power.cpp:
   - Defined REG_POWER.
   - Added readPower() function using a Power_LSB of 0.03W/bit.
   - Appended power to the serial print output.
8. User requested the output be converted to CSV format.
9. Modified the serial output in loop() to print values separated by commas.
10. Delivered the final file as CO_Skeleton_03_CSV.cpp.

All modifications were made carefully to preserve functionality while enhancing precision and data recording.
