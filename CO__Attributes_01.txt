**Coordinator (CO) Attributes**

The Coordinator (CO) is an Arduino Nano responsible for overseeing and managing system control, communication, and startup verification.

---

**Core Responsibilities:**
- Drives the system control logic.
- Interfaces with the INA219 current sensor via I2C, using an ISO1540 I2C isolator.
- Reads thermistor data to monitor plate temperature.
- Controls the system relay and fan (only with Watchdog permission).
- Communicates serially with the PC (for data logging) and with the Watchdog via GPIO and optional serial.
- Issues system state via a dedicated GPIO to Watchdog.

---

**Startup Behavior (setup):**
1. Set all pin modes and default states.
2. Begin serial communication.
3. Initialize I2C (INA219 communication).
4. Perform safety tests:
   - Fan test (turn ON fan, ensure temp does not rise).
   - Relay test (ensure bus voltage is present).
   - Confirm INA219 is communicating.
   - Verify reasonable thermistor reading.
5. After passing tests, raise GPIO signal to WD indicating "ready."

**Runtime Responsibilities (loop):**
- Monitor current and temperature.
- Format and send serial data stream to PC.
- Send shutdown or emergency commands to WD as needed:
  - "SHUTDOWN\n" for controlled stop.
  - "ALL STOP\n" for emergency shutdown.
- Accept override of fan and relay control by WD.
- Optionally process status or interrupt signal from WD.

**Pin Usage:**
- A0: Thermistor analog input.
- SDA/SCL: I2C bus to INA219.
- D5: Relay control (active HIGH) — only with WD permission.
- D7: Fan control (active LOW) — only with WD permission.
- D3: Status output to WD (HIGH = "I'm alive").
- D2: Interrupt input from WD (emergency stop triggered by WD).

---

**Communication Notes:**
- Serial.print() stream includes Vgs, current, shunt_mV, plate temperature, and PWM.
- WD does not respond via I2C or UART but may trigger an interrupt via D2.
- CO must handle emergency shutdown immediately if interrupted.

---

**Failsafe Behavior:**
- If D2 interrupt is triggered by WD, CO enters emergency shutdown.
- CO will maintain fan ON after shutdown until temperature drops below threshold.
- Relay remains OFF during and after shutdown.
- CO continues serial output for diagnostics after shutdown.
